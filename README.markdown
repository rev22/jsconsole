## JS Console

A JavaScript (and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.com)) web console, useful 
for quick experimentation, debugging, presentations (for live coding) and workshops.

This is a fork of [jsconsole.com](http://jsconsole.com), optimized for indipendent hosting/experimentation.

## Features

- Remote device debugging using "listen" command ([more info](http://jsconsole.com/remote-debugging.html))
- Resizable font (yep, biggest issue with Firebug in workshops)
- Autocomplete in WebKit desktop browsers
- shift + up/down for bigger console
- Save history (based on session)
- Add support for loading in a DOM (YQL - I thank you again)
- Permalink to individual executions

## Hosting jsconsole yourself

The server-side code is used mainly only for the remote debugging feature.

This requires that you install [node.js](http://nodejs.org). Once installed, 
download this project (or clone it using git) 
and inside the new `jsconsole` directory run:

    npm install
    
This will install the dependancies (in particular 1.8.x version of connect.js).

Once installed, run (on port 80):

    node server.js
    
Or to run on a specific port (like 8080):

    node server.js 8080
    
Then check your own ip address of the machine it's running on (using `ipconfig` 
for windows or `ifconfig` for mac and linux). Then on the mobile phone, just 
visit that IP address and port you're running jsconsole on:
